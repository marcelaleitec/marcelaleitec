Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm simple as it should be. Rock lover :heart_eyes:, art lover :heart_eyes:, design lover :heart_eyes:, woman, mother, daughter, sister, wife, just myself.

I'm diving into the universe of programming and I intend to make a career out of it. :smirk:
I am still studying the paths I can take.
